# Optical-beams-MEEP
Simulation of reflection and refraction of polarized opticial beams at plane and curved dielectric interfaces.
* Collection of Scheme configuration files for Gaussian beams, Laguerre-Gaussian (vortex) beams and Airy beams
* Based on [Meep](https://github.com/stevengj/meep) as underlying FDTD simulation software package
